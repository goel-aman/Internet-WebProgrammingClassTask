        <span style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">A paragraph is a series
            of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic.</span>

            style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Try
            to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that
            supports one central, unified idea.</span>
        <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your

    <h3><u><b>Invisible Man <i>(author Ralph Ellison)</i></b></u></h3>
    <p>
        The narrator of Invisible Man is a nameless young black man who moves in a 20th-century United States
        where reality is surreal and who can survive only through pretense. Because the people he encounters
        "see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their <i><b>imagination</b></i>," he is effectively
        invisible.
