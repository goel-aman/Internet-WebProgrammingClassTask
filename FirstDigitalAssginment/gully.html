    <h2>Gully Position
    </h2>
    <p>
        Like slip, gully is an attacking fielding position behind the wicket on the off side. He stands squarer and
        deeper
        than the slips. The position is in place to both take catches and save runs. Gully is in the game is when a
        batsman
        is cutting off the back foot.

    <h2>Best Cricketers At Gully Position</h2>
    <p>
        Jonty Rhodes and Yuvraj Singh have been superb gully fielders. Standing at slip, especially to a spinner is one
        of the hardest positions as you only get a fraction of a second to judge a catch. Most of the times, a thick
        edge could induce a lot of speed and slips need to be alert at all times.
