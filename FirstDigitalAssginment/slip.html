    <h2>Slip Position</h2>
    <p>
        In cricket, a slip fielder (collectively, a slip cordon or the slips) is placed behind the batter on the off
        side of the field. ... As fielding in the slips requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept
        catchers in the team will make up the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batters.

        fielders of all time.</p>
