<!-- 4. According to Wikipedia a happy number is defined by the following process :
"Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of
its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it
loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this
process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy
numbers (or sad numbers).Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5
happy numbers. -->
