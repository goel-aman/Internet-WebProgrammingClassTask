<!-- A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage charges an additional $0.50 per
hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00.
Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write a script that calculates and displays the parking
charges for each customer who parked a car in this garage yesterday. You should input from the user the hours parked for
each customer. The program should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the
running total of yesterday's receipts. The program should use the function calculate-Charges to determine the charge for
each customer. Use a text input field to obtain the input from the user -->
